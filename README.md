This project is a C++ application that manages a network of robots designed to clean the air in urban environments. The application focuses on the development of core functionalities necessary to monitor and control the robots in real-time. It allows users to manage robot deployment, monitor their status, and oversee the efficiency of air cleaning in specific zones. The application is intentionally left incomplete as part of a staged development process, focusing on key features.

# Features
  Robot Deployment: Assign robots to specific zones for air cleaning operations.
  Monitor Robot Status: Check the status of each robot, including its current position, battery level, and operational state.
  Air Quality Monitoring: Retrieve real-time air quality data from each zone and track the improvements.
  Manual Robot Control: Option to manually override the robotsâ€™ cleaning paths.
  Basic Error Handling: Detect and report when a robot encounters an obstacle or low battery.
# Technologies Used
  C++: Core development language used for efficient memory management and real-time processing.
  Object-Oriented Design (OOD): The application uses a modular design, making it easier to extend and maintain.
